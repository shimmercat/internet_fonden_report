<h1>Preliminary Data<a class="headerlink" href="#preliminary-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To better understand the context in which the HTTP/2 Push technologies
and cache digests can be employed, we have added some contextual data in
this section.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-much-web-traffic-is-out-there-anyway">
<h2>How much web traffic is out there anyway?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-much-web-traffic-is-out-there-anyway" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the time of this writing, the number of websites is stable around
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">billion</span> <span class="pre">&lt;http://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/&gt;</span></code>_.
However, people don&#8217;t visit those sites with the same frequency. In
fact, most traffic goes to just a few sites.</p>
<p>Here is a table with a few websites that we obtained from
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SimilarWeb</span> <span class="pre">&lt;https://www.similarweb.com/&gt;</span></code>_:</p>
<p>SimilarWeb provides only estimations, but we compared their estimations
with some websites to which we have access to the Analytics data and we
could see that the orders of magnitude were correct in all instances.</p>
<p>This leads to a simple conclusion: most websites out there don&#8217;t need
more than one CPU to handle all the traffic that they receive. Or put in
less controversial terms, for each website out there that needs to load
balance its traffic between several CPUs, there are a few thousand
websites that can work fine with a single CPU.</p>
<p>Other than traffic, there may be other legitimate reasons distribute the
servers of a website geographically. One of them is redundancy. But the
reason that most often network administrators cite is the degradation on
speed due to network latency.</p>

<h2>For most websites, latency is the primary performance killer<a class="headerlink" href="#for-most-websites-latency-is-the-primary-performance-killer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Latency is the time required by a web request to go from browser to
server and back. Since browsers often need to request assets in
sequence, the degradation on performance implied by latency tends to
amplify itself.</p>
<p>Latency being the primary performance killer is widely known finding,
for two reputable sources, see:</p>

<h2>HTTP/2 Push and Cache digests<a class="headerlink" href="#http-2-push-and-cache-digests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>HTTP/2 was approved as an Internet Protocol in 2015 in <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540">RFC
7540</a>. HTTP/2 is at its core a
frames protocol. Frames are part of streams, and streams are identified
by a number. The stream number is present in each frame as a binary
field. Streams &#8211; and their numbers &#8211; allow to match requests and
responses.</p>
<p>As by RFC 7540, <em>&#8220;HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network
resources and a reduced perception of latency</em>&#8221;. One of the techniques
that help reduce the effects of latency is HTTP/2 Push. It does so by
allowing a web server to send resources to a browser before the browser
gets to request them.</p>
<p>In order to save network resources when doing HTTP/2 Push, a web server
should know which assets the browser already has in its cache. Here is
where cache digests enter. Cache digests were first implemented by
Kazuho Oku in his H2O server, and then published by him and Mark
Nottingham as an <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kazuho-h2-cache-digest-00">Internet
draft</a>.</p>
