What is this report
-------------------

In our opinion, the combination of HTTP/2 Push, cache
digests and some other latency-hiding techniques can reshape the digital
services industry by making fast websites more affordable to
small players and individuals.

This report pulls together some data that hopefully will inform better the
comunity.

Scope
-----

We focus in a typical scenario where the two communication endpoints are a
web server and a web browser.
For us, cache digests is interesting as a mean to create faster websites from the perspective
of end users.
In particular, we don't research the implications of using cache digests for communication
between an intermediate proxy and an origin server.
