<h1>Data on cache and cache digest sizes<a class="headerlink" href="#data-on-cache-and-cache-digest-sizes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The more fundamental raw data about cache size can be found in the GitHub repository
where this report lives.</p>
<p>The data with other statistics, from the third-subsection and onwards, is more bulky
and as such we haven&#8217;t found a nice format to make it public.
On the other hand, the facts in section third and onwards are well known, and we
are just reinforcing the point.</p>
<div class="section" id="size-of-caches">
<h2>Size of caches<a class="headerlink" href="#size-of-caches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Browsers organize their cache in different ways, and the data we show here
is concerned to only one browser, Mozilla Firefox.
However, we have read some of the source code that makes part
of  Google Chrome and we know that its cache is based in similar principles.</p>
<p>The basic message is that the average site, which is visited only sporadically
by a user, has very little content in cache.
We got that because we sampled a typical Firefox cache.
Here is in some more detail on how it looks.</p>
<p>In our data sample, the average number of cached assets per domain was between six
and seven.
But as shown in the pie chart below, that distribution was heavily tailed:</p>
<img alt="../_images/proportion_assets.png" src="../_images/proportion_assets.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Almost 70% goes to domains that have between 0 and 5 assets in cache.</li>
<li>The next 15% contains domains that have between 5 and 10 assets in cache.</li>
<li>And the final, thinest slice goes to sites that have between 120 and
180 assets in cache.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sites that set a low number of assets in cache have either a low number of views from
the user (and thus the users&#8217;s browser tends to not cache the contents), or perhaps more
typically, are service or sharding domains.</p>
<p>The last numbers on the other hand are more indicative of what is the typical number of
assets that a browser would need to hold in cache for a site, if that site was frequented
enough by the user for the browser to decide to include as many pieces of it in
cache as possible.</p>
<p>Here is the list of sites with biggest representations in cache and some
comentaries_:</p>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">  <thead>    <tr style="text-align: right;">      <th></th>      <th>0</th>      <th>1</th>    </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>    <tr>      <th>0</th>      <td>164</td>      <td>apx.moatads.com</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>1</th>      <td>113</td>      <td>bonanzleimages.s3.amazonaws.com</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>2</th>      <td>76</td>      <td>cdn.salehoo.com</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>3</th>      <td>67</td>      <td>www.shimmercat.com</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>4</th>      <td>63</td>      <td>pagead2.googlesyndication.com</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>5</th>      <td>62</td>      <td>v4.moatads.com</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>6</th>      <td>57</td>      <td>www.salehoo.com</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>7</th>      <td>54</td>      <td>img0.etsystatic.com</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>8</th>      <td>52</td>      <td>srv-2016-06-27-11.pixel.parsely.com</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>9</th>      <td>52</td>      <td>img1.etsystatic.com</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><ul class="simple">
<li>The first site in the list is an ads engine. So, if you ever wondered what was somebody thinking
when you got to their website and saw ads rendered before main contents from the site, now you know
that probably the ads that were following you from site to site  were cached right in your browser
but the main contents of the website were not.</li>
<li>Other origins listed include CDN and media domains for a few sites. I visited some of those sites
(etsy.com, salehoo.com) for first time the day that I collected the data, but some other sites
(shimmercat.com) I visit regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also notice that big websites tend to split their assets over different domains due to
the performance practice called &#8220;domain sharding&#8221;.</p>

<div class="section" id="implied-size-of-cache-digests">
<h2>Implied size of cache digests<a class="headerlink" href="#implied-size-of-cache-digests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>How many bytes would be required for digests that comprehend 50 requests?
It depends on the  probability P of false positives used.
With P equal 1/32, one can assume an average bit length per asset in the digest not larger than one
byte.
By the numbers in the previous section, the largest digest wouldn&#8217;t be longer than 167 bytes.
That&#8217;s not a big amount, specially because those bytes can be sent at a time where the HTTP/2 connection
is mostly idle in the direction from browser to server.</p>
<p>Do we have reassurances that this numbers are typical enough? Yes, they follow
what others have found (see statcounter.com) and what a study

<p><strong>Normalized density</strong> is the height of the bar so that when you multiply it by its width, you get
the frequency that the bar represents.
For example, the first bar in the plot represents 0.0096 * 25 = 0.24, that is, 24% (which is not
far from our 25% percentile with 26 requests).</p>

<p>Now, this is the time waiting for a single request.
The browser does many requests concurrently.
So, even if the browser is waiting for one resource, it may be the case that is fetching
other resources and therefore network capacity is being used anyway.</p>

the browser is not receiving data for any request, but the browser has sent some requests
and is waiting for their responses. That is, there are requests in flight even if no
data is being received for them.</li>
<li>Ideally, we want to lower that proportion as much as possible.</li>
<li>The mean of that proportion is 0.39. That is, in average, a browser spends 39% of the time
until the load event without receiving data.</li>
<li>The 25% percentile was at 0.24. That is, the best quarter of sites managed to not-use
the network 24% of the time or less.</li>

<h2>The possible impact of effective HTTP/2 Push<a class="headerlink" href="#the-possible-impact-of-effective-http-2-push" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By the data above, HTGTP/2 Push would help sites to load in average 40% faster.
Therefore, we encourage any efforts to give this technique wider adoption.</p>
<p>In our conversations with web developers, one of the first objections is the
risk of pushing assets that the browser already has.
Cache digests is precisely  a way around this problem.</p>
